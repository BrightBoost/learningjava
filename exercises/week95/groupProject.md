#  Group project

## Option 1
You have two options, go wild and create anything you want to build with these constraints:
- You'll have to use Github with more than one account connected to the repo and use of feature branches
- No direct commits to main are allowed, create pull requests instead
- It should be a Java app with at least 3 has-a or is-a relations
- At least 5 usages of Java Streams (maps, sort, group, filter etc)

## Option 2
Or if you need more guidance, choose from any of the below project ideas:
- mini netflix catalog system
- school admin system
- tamagotchi game
- recipe recommendation system
- all sorts of console based games (think DnD)

Same constraints apply:
- You'll have to use Github with more than one account connected to the repo and use of feature branches
- No direct commits to main are allowed, create pull requests instead
- It should be a Java app with at least 3 has-a or is-a relations
- At least 5 usages of Java Streams (maps, sort, group, filter etc)
