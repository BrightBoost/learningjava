1. Make sure profile is optimal
    - Headline (use wisely)
    - Link could you put your github portfolio website
    - description
    - featured section (links to github, to posts you did)
    - all you experiences, also not relevant ones (but stack them in one if possible)
2. Add skills + endorse each other
3. Add 10 people in the field that look interesting (could be yearup colleagues)
4. Add a post with an image or a video, for example about what you learned in the capstone week, what the weirdest Java thing so far is, how it is to be reschooled etc
