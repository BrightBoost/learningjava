Create a Language model (just a class) with an id and a name + getters, setters, constructors.

---

I want you to create a LanguageDAO with the following methods:
- getAll
- getById
- getByName

1. In this DAO: no printing, no prompting. Very general class

2. Then, create an app. The app allows to:
- get all the languages and print them.
- Get all the languages and print them reversed. 
- Get a language by name. 
- Get a language by id. 
- Exit app.
