# Mini Exercises — Java Maps

## 1) First contact: phone book (HashMap)

Create a `Map<String, String>` for a tiny phone book with three entries.
**Tasks:**

* Add three names with phone numbers.
* Look up one number by name and print it.
* Check if a certain name exists before printing.

## 2) Word → length dictionary

Given a `List<String>` of words, build a `Map<String, Integer>` mapping each word to its length.
**Tasks:**

* Put each (word → length).
* Print the length for `"elephant"`; if missing, print `"not found"`.

## 3) Bonus: Counting with a frequency map

Given a list `["apple","pear","apple","banana","apple","pear"]`, build a frequency map `Map<String,Integer>`.
**Tasks:**

* Increment counts correctly.
* Print: `apple=3, pear=2, banana=1`.
