# üè∞ The Battle for Hogwarts: A Complete OOP Adventure

## üìñ Story Overview

Dark forces are threatening Hogwarts! The Ministry of Magic has commissioned you to build a magical combat system to prepare students and professors for the upcoming battle. You'll create a complete object-oriented system that tracks magical beings, their abilities, spells, and battle outcomes.

---

## üéØ Project Requirements

You will build a multi-class system with inheritance, composition, polymorphism, and abstraction. The project is divided into phases that build upon each other.

---

## üìã Phase 1: The Foundation - Abstract Magical Beings

### Story Context
Before we can have wizards and creatures, we need to define what it means to be a magical being in this world.

### Tasks

**1.1 Create an Abstract Class: `MagicalBeing`**

Properties:
- `name` (String)
- `health` (int) - starts at 100
- `magicalPower` (int) - represents overall magical strength
- `isAlive` (boolean) - true if health > 0

Abstract Methods:
- `attack(MagicalBeing target)` - each type attacks differently
- `getType()` - returns a String describing what type of being this is

Concrete Methods:
- `takeDamage(int damage)` - reduces health, sets isAlive to false if health <= 0
- `heal(int amount)` - increases health (max 100)
- `introduce()` - prints name and type
- Constructor that takes name and magicalPower

**Test Your Code:**
- Try to instantiate `MagicalBeing` directly (it should fail - it's abstract!)
- This confirms your abstract class is set up correctly

---

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Phase 2: The Wizarding Classes

### Story Context
Now we'll create the different types of magical beings that will fight in the battle. Each has unique abilities and fighting styles.

### Tasks

**2.1 Create `Wizard` Class (extends MagicalBeing)**

Additional Properties:
- `house` (String) - Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, or Ravenclaw
- `yearOfStudy` (int) - 1 through 7
- `wand` (Wand) - composition! Each wizard has a wand

Constructor:
- Takes name, magicalPower, house, and yearOfStudy
- Creates a default wand for now (we'll improve this later)

Methods:
- Implement `attack(MagicalBeing target)` - deals damage based on magicalPower and yearOfStudy
    - Damage formula: `(magicalPower / 10) + yearOfStudy`
    - Print: "[name] from [house] casts a spell at [target]!"
- Implement `getType()` - returns "Student Wizard"
- `study()` - increases yearOfStudy by 1 (max 7) and magicalPower by 5

**2.2 Create `Professor` Class (extends Wizard)**

Additional Properties:
- `subject` (String) - Defense Against Dark Arts, Potions, Transfiguration, etc.
- `yearsTeaching` (int)

Constructor:
- Takes name, magicalPower, house, subject
- Sets yearOfStudy to 7 automatically (professors are fully trained!)
- Sets yearsTeaching to 0

Methods:
- Override `attack(MagicalBeing target)` - professors are more powerful!
    - Damage formula: `(magicalPower / 10) + yearOfStudy + yearsTeaching`
    - Print: "Professor [name] casts a powerful [subject] spell at [target]!"
- Override `getType()` - returns "Professor of [subject]"
- `teachStudent(Wizard student)` - calls the student's study() method
    - Print: "Professor [name] teaches [student] advanced [subject]"

**2.3 Create `DarkWizard` Class (extends Wizard)**

Additional Properties:
- `darkArtsLevel` (int) - how powerful their dark magic is (1-10)
- `cursesKnown` (ArrayList<String>) - list of dark curses they know

Constructor:
- Takes name, magicalPower, darkArtsLevel
- Sets house to "None" (they've abandoned their houses)
- Sets yearOfStudy to 7
- Initializes cursesKnown list with at least 3 dark curses

Methods:
- Override `attack(MagicalBeing target)` - dark wizards are ruthless!
    - Damage formula: `(magicalPower / 10) + yearOfStudy + (darkArtsLevel * 2)`
    - Print: "üíÄ [name] casts [random curse from list] at [target]!"
- Override `getType()` - returns "Dark Wizard"
- `learnDarkCurse(String curse)` - adds a new curse to their list

---

## ü™Ñ Phase 3: The Wand System (Composition)

### Story Context
"The wand chooses the wizard, Harry." Every wizard needs a proper wand, and different wands grant different abilities.

### Tasks

**3.1 Create `Wand` Class**

Properties:
- `wood` (String) - Holly, Elder, Willow, etc.
- `core` (String) - Phoenix feather, Dragon heartstring, Unicorn hair
- `length` (double) - in inches
- `powerBonus` (int) - how much extra power this wand provides

Constructor:
- Takes wood, core, and length
- Calculates powerBonus based on the combination:
    - Phoenix feather core: +10
    - Dragon heartstring core: +8
    - Unicorn hair core: +6
    - Elder wood: +5 additional
    - Other combinations: base value only

Methods:
- `getDescription()` - returns a formatted string: "[length]\" [wood] wand with [core] core"
- `isElderWand()` - returns true if wood is "Elder" and core is "Phoenix feather"

**3.2 Create `WandShop` Class (Static Methods)**

This class uses static methods because there's only one Ollivanders shop!

Static Methods:
- `createCustomWand(String wood, String core, double length)` - creates and returns a new Wand
- `createRandomWand()` - creates a wand with random properties
    - Arrays of wood types, cores to choose from randomly
- `repairWand(Wand wand)` - prints "Wand repaired by Ollivander!" (for now)

**3.3 Update Wizard Class**

- Modify constructor to accept a Wand parameter
- Add `getWand()` and `setWand(Wand wand)` methods
- Modify `attack()` method to include wand's powerBonus in damage calculation

- `requiredPowerLevel` (int) - minimum magicalPower needed to cast

Constructor:
- Takes all properties

Methods:
- `cast(MagicalBeing caster, MagicalBeing target)` - executes the spell
    - Check if caster has enough magicalPower
    - If offensive: call target.takeDamage(damageAmount)
    - If healing: call target.heal(damageAmount)
    - If defensive: print protective message (we'll enhance this later)
    - Print: "[caster] casts [spell name]!"

- `listSpells()` - prints all known spells
- `getStrongestSpell()` - returns the spell with highest damage

**4.3 Update Wizard Class**

- Add `spellBook` (SpellBook) property
- Initialize in constructor
- Add method `learnNewSpell(Spell spell)` - delegates to spellBook

**4.4 Create `SpellLibrary` Class (Static)**

Static ArrayList:
- `availableSpells` - a library of all spells in the world

Static Methods:
- `initializeSpells()` - creates famous spells and adds to library:
    - Expelliarmus (Offensive, 15 damage, requires 30 power)
    - Stupefy (Offensive, 20 damage, requires 40 power)
    - Protego (Defensive, 0 damage, requires 25 power)
    - Episkey (Healing, 25 heal, requires 35 power)
    - Avada Kedavra (Offensive, 100 damage, requires 95 power)
    - Add at least 5 more of your own creation!
- `getAllSpells()` - returns the list
- `getSpellByName(String name)` - searches and returns specific spell
- `getSpellsForPowerLevel(int powerLevel)` - returns spells wizard can learn

Call `initializeSpells()` in a static block so it runs when class loads!
