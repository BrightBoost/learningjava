# 🐍 Reptile Adoption Agency – A Self-Paced OOP Discovery Activity

You're about to help build the structure for a **Reptile Adoption Agency system** — but you won’t write any code (yet). Instead, you'll learn how programmers think about **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** by drawing, brainstorming, and exploring.

This activity will guide you step by step. You’ll discover:

* What classes are
* What properties (attributes) are
* What methods (actions) are
* How OOP helps us organize systems

---

## ✨ Step 1: Discover the Main Things (aka Classes)

🧩 **Task:**

Imagine you're running a reptile adoption center.

Ask yourself:

* What kinds of reptiles do we help find homes for?
* What other things or people are involved in this agency?
* What real-world things do we need to represent in our system?

✏️ **Do this:**

* List at least 3–5 types of reptiles or roles in the agency.
* Bonus: Draw them if you’d like!

**Example answers:**

* Snake, Lizard, Turtle, Chameleon
* Customer, AdoptionForm

---

📘 **Reflection – What You Just Did:**

You just discovered **classes**!
A **class** is a blueprint or category for a kind of thing — like `Snake`, `Customer`, or `AdoptionForm`.

Every time we create a specific version of that thing (e.g., a lizard named Lizzy), we create an **object**, or an **instance** of the class.

---

## 🏷️ Step 2: Discover What Each Thing Knows (aka Properties)

🧩 **Task:**

Pick one class from your list — for example, `Reptile`.

Ask yourself:

* What details should we keep track of for each reptile?
* What would we write on its cage label?
* What makes one reptile different from another?

✏️ **Do this:**

* List at least 4–6 properties that a reptile should have.
* Draw a reptile and write the properties around it.

**Example answers:**

* `name`, `species`, `age`, `length`, `diet`, `isVenomous`, `adoptionStatus`

---

📘 **Reflection – What You Just Did:**

You just designed **properties** (or **attributes**) of a class.
These describe what the object **knows** or **has**. Every reptile has the same kinds of properties, but with different values.

For example:

* `name = Lizzy`
* `age = 4`
* `isVenomous = false`

You’re thinking like a programmer!

## ⚙️ Step 3: Discover What Each Thing Can Do (aka Methods)

🧩 **Task:**

Now think about the **actions** your reptile (or other class) can perform.

Ask yourself:

* What does a reptile do?
* What can someone do *to* a reptile in this agency?
* What happens when a reptile gets adopted?

✏️ **Do this:**

* List 3–5 actions a reptile might perform or respond to.
* You can draw action buttons or speech bubbles around your reptile drawing!

**Example answers:**

* `feed()`, `shedSkin()`, `makeSound()`, `markAsAdopted()`, `printInfoTag()`

---

📘 **Reflection – What You Just Did:**

You just created **methods**!
Methods are what an object **can do** — they’re the *verbs* of the class.

For example, if you call `feed()` on Lizzy the Lizard, maybe the system shows an animation or updates the “lastFed” time.

---

📘 **Final Reflection – What You’ve Learned:**

You just explored **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in action!
Here's what you now understand:

| Concept         | What it means                                |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Class**       | A blueprint or category (e.g., `Reptile`)    |
| **Object**      | A specific instance (e.g., Lizzy the Lizard) |
| **Property**    | Information the object knows (e.g., `age`)   |
| **Method**      | Actions the object can do (e.g., `feed()`)   |
| **Inheritance** | A way for classes to share and reuse code    |

You’ve designed an entire system — the OOP way — without writing a single line of code.

### 🎉 Bonus: Want to Take It Further?

## 🧠 Challenge: Step 4: Look at the Big Picture

🎯 **Now think about this:**

* Do some classes have the same properties or methods?
* Could we create a general class like `Reptile`, and have subclasses like `Snake` or `Turtle` that **inherit** from it?
* Can each subclass **override** a method, like having its own version of `makeSound()`?

✏️ **Do this (Optional Advanced Challenge):**

* Draw a class tree with a general `Reptile` class and specific child classes like `Snake`, `Turtle`, `Chameleon`.
* Add shared properties to the parent, and special ones to each child.

---

* Try this same process for a **robot pet store**, **fantasy zoo**, or **space exploration center**.
* Or..... if you're ready to start coding, try implementing the `Reptile` class in your favorite language!
