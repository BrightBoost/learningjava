## Continue from the previous exercise
- Create a new abstract class Bean (don't make it a component)
- Give it a String recipe (add it to the constructor and add getters and setters)
- Make the beans extend from this class Bean and make sure recipe is initialized using the application.properties and then @Value
- (This should go in the constructor of the beans)
- Run the application and all should be good
- Create a new class BeanSoup (annotate with @Component)
- BeanSoup has a field of type Bean
- Run the application and it should crash
- Why is it crashing?
- You can fix this with the @Qualifier annotation, do independent research to solve this
