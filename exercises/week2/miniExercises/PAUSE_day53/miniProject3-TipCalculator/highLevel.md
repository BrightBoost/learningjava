## 🧠 **Project: Tip Calculator**

### 🎯 Goal (High Level):
Create a program that:
1. Asks the user for the bill amount.
2. Asks the user for the desired tip percentage.
3. Calculates the tip amount.
4. Calculates the total bill.
5. Rounds both using `Math.ceil()` and `Math.floor()` for fun.

### 🪄 Optional Bonus Challenges
Want to keep it fresh? Try one of these:
- Ask the user how many people to split the bill with and show per-person cost.
- Format output to two decimals using `String.format()` or `System.out.printf()`.
- If tip percentage is less than 10%, print a cheeky message like: *“Cheapskate alert 😅”*
