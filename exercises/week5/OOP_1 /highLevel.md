### 🐾 **Your OOP Exercise: Cats & Dogs Edition!** 🐾

#### **High-level Instructions (for confident coders)**
Time to make your own mini zoo! You’re going to create two Java classes: one for `Cat`, and one for `Dog`. Each class will have some fields (characteristics like color, age, number of legs, etc.) and one method (something the animal can *do*, like `meow()` or `bark()`).

After creating the classes, you’ll create your `App` class and in the `main` method you'll:
1. Create a few `Cat` and `Dog` objects.
2. Fill in their fields (give them names, ages, colors, etc.).
3. Call the method to show what the animal does.
4. (Optional but fun!) Show how changing one object can affect another if you point two variables to the same object.

Let your creativity loose — make a barking bulldog, a sneaky Siamese, or a very spoiled lapdog. 🐕‍🦺🐈

### 🏁 When you’re done:
- Try adding one more field or method to each class if you’re feeling bold!
- Can your cat `sleep()`? Can your dog `wagTail()`?
