## üõ†Ô∏è **Your OOP Exercise: Houses & Cars Edition!** üõ†Ô∏è

### **High-Level Instructions (for confident coders)**

You're going to build two classes:
1. `House`
2. `Car`

Each class will have a few fields (things like color, number of rooms, brand, make, model, number of wheels etc.) and one method that does something fun like `openDoor()` or `startEngine()`.

Then, in your `App` class's `main` method:
- Create a few `House` and `Car` objects.
- Fill in the fields (give them a color, a number of windows, a top speed, etc.).
- Call their method.
- (Optional) Show what happens when you assign one object to another variable and change something.

‚ú® Feel free to make your car electric, your house haunted, or both!

### üí° Bonus ideas if you're done early:
- Add a new method to each class: maybe `paint()` for `House`, or `honk()` for `Car`.
- Try creating a third object and setting its fields to something wild.
- Try printing the objects' fields directly using `System.out.println()`.
