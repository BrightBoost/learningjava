1. Create a Calculator class
2. Add 4 methods that take 2 doubles as params, and implement them:
   - Add
   - Subtract
   - Multiply
   - Divide
3. Right click, generate, Test (see workbook for details how to do this)
4. Implement a "happy path" test for each of them

**Note:** Happy path is when nothing goes wrong, so 2 + 2 = 4 etc
