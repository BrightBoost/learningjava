## CHALLENGE: Northwind — 5 “Management Report” Exercises

**N1. Product Performance Snapshot**
Management asks: *“Which products are clearly underperforming? Give us a list of products that are in stock but rarely ordered.”*
Create a report that shows each product’s name, units in stock, and how many times it appears in `order_details`, and filter it so that only products with **plenty of stock** but **very few orders** appear.

---

**N2. High-Value Countries**
Management asks: *“For which countries are we shipping a lot of value?”*
Create a report per ship country that shows the **number of orders** and the **total freight** for that country, but only include countries that clearly stand out as strong markets.

---

**N3. Employee Order Load**
Management asks: *“Are any sales reps overloaded compared to the others?”*
Create a report per employee that shows their full name and how many orders they handled. Only show employees whose number of orders is **above the overall average** number of orders per employee.

---

**N4. Expensive Product Focus**
Management asks: *“We want to focus on our premium products. Which categories contain products that are generally high priced?”*
Create a report per category (using only the IDs or names you can get without JOINs) that shows the **average unit price** and the **number of products** in that category. Only include categories where the **average price** is relatively high compared to the other categories.

---

**N5. Slow Shipping Detection**
Management asks: *“Where are we slow in shipping?”*
Create a report that, for each ship country, shows the **average delay** between `OrderDate` and `ShippedDate` (you may ignore orders that haven’t shipped yet). Only show countries with a noticeably higher average delay than others.

Create a report per staff member showing **how many payments** they processed and the **total amount** they collected, and highlight only the staff whose total collected amount is **above the overall average**.

---

**S2. Profitable Rental Durations**
Management asks: *“Is it worth keeping long rental-duration films, or do shorter films also bring in good income?”*
Create a report that groups films by their `rental_duration` and shows the **number of films**, and the **average rental rate** for each duration. Identify which rental durations look the most profitable.

---

**S3. Customer Activity Segmentation**
Management asks: *“Which customers are active enough to be considered for a loyalty program?”*
Based on the `rental` or `payment` data, create a report with each customer’s ID and their **total number of rentals or payments**. Only include customers whose activity is clearly higher than the typical customer.

---

**S4. Rating vs. Length Insight**
Management asks: *“Are certain film ratings associated with longer films?”*
Create a report per rating that shows the **average film length** and the **number of films** for that rating. Use this to identify ratings where films tend to be significantly longer than the global average length.

---

**S5. Long Tail of Unpopular Films**
Management asks: *“Do we have a long tail of films that almost nobody rents?”*
Create a report that shows each film’s title and how many times it appears in the `rental` table. Then filter the result to show only films that are rented **far below the average** rental count per film.
