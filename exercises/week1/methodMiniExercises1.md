## Theme: *Code Quest – The Static Adventure*

You're helping a team of game developers build utility methods for their new retro fantasy game *Code Quest*. Each static method represents a small in-game action or system helper.

### 1. public static void printWelcome()
> Write a static method that prints:
```
"Welcome to Code Quest!"
```
→ Then invoke it in `main()`.

> Write a static method that prints:
```
"Player joined: [name]"
```
→ Call it with a name of your choice.

### 3. public static void showLevel(int level)
> Write a static method that prints:
```
"Level: [level]"
```
→ Call it twice with different levels.

### 4. public static void attack(String attacker, String target)
> Write a static method that prints:
```
"[attacker] attacks [target]!"

### 6. public static void castSpell(String wizard, String spellName, int manaCost)
