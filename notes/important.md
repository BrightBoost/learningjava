## About static and non-static

- If we need an instance of something to be able to perform a certain action. That action is non-static.
- For example: in order to print a document, we need a printer. Print is non-static.
- Another example: In order to calculate the square root we need mathematics. 
  - We can calculate without having an instance of mathematics (e.g. it's universal and you dont have to get your own copy).
  - This makes the square root calculation static.
- Static context can only reference static context.
